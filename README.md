### hiberus challenge

Android app based in the client-server paradigm that allows the user to control
its own drone with our app, watching in real time the camera of the drone on the
mobile screen and showing all the nearest Access Points sharing Wi-Fi.

That feature will allow the user to interact  with its environment smarter,
searching for the better hotspot, or the worst if wants to isolate him.

The client server module is coded in Python 3.4 and the Android app (that can
be located [here](https://github.com/cgardev/DroneClient) ) is coded in Java.
